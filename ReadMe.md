# Thank you

I would like to start by thanking you all for the opportinity, the test itself was fun and in hindsight I made an assumption within the meeting room that the finger could go from 1 to 0 in 1second and not the 9seconds like it should take! This is then led me down a wild rabbit hole!

## Run & Use the code

To use the code for you own test you can require the module to access the function
```
var bangalore = require('./bangalore')
```

I have also created some very basic tests

```
npm run test
```

If you wish to modify the Typescript then please perform a clean install to add the typescript dependancies.
```
npm install
npm run build // will compile the typescript
```
